## GIT STRUCTURE
- main
- development

## TASK A considerations for TASK D 
- blockers (git detatched head)
- postgresql errors (the project actually doesn't need a db at all, should have excluded that in the set-up and will need to exclude that later)

## TASK B considerations for TASK D 
- blockers how to pass parameters securely between controller methods 
- checking if another list would disrupt my flexbox
